OOD Explained

User interaction (UI)
---------------------
- In ca.cmpt213.as2.textui package, the MazeGameText class instantiates both the Game class, and the MazeTextUI class.
- The UI takes a reference to the game in its constructor.
- UI class controls the sequence of actions in the game, but the game class has all the logic.
- UI class able to print game board to screen and ask for user input.

Maze Creation
-------------
- MazeGame class instantiates a Maze object for tracking the maze. 
- Maze object implements randomized Prim's algorithm to generate the maze.
- Once generated, it randomly removes some walls to create loops in the maze. 
- It also ensures the four corners are not walls to facilitate the player and cats appearing on board.
- Finally, using a flood-fill algorithm, the PathFinder class is used to ensure that all four corners have paths.


Tracking Visible Maze
---------------------
- The CellState class represents the state for a single cell in the game board.
- It tracks when it is visible or not.
- At startup, the cells around the player are made visible by the MazeGame class.
- As the player moves, all cells around the player are made visible.
- Logic is slightly simplified because the game board is surrounded by a wall, and hence cannot go out of bounds.
